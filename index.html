        This website started as an idea when Kelsey Toporski was a freshman in college taking my first <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/women"> Women's Studies</a> class. As a junior, she had the skill set to make it happen. Growing up in a small, rural, conservative town, this class was really her first introduction to feminism and feminist thought, and she wanted to share her new found knowledge with others. This website is where a lot of feminist things could be compiled in one place, purely because people might not otherwise know about it. Her hometown may not have been forward thinking, but it did have internet connection.

        <span>Kelsey's DISCLAIMER:</span> I did not know everything!! I'm only human - I'm still growing and learning and I have a limited knowledge of things, but I will do my best and work to make this page as inclusive and unbiased as possible.
